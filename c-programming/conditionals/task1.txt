Better the program to print out defferals or removals.

Your work is to:
1) Deffer the Student to an exact cohort if the student is eligble for defferals.
2) Print out invalid scores, cohort, and return the users name on each print out.

Maximum score is 185.
Maximum cohort is 14.


You should write your anwser in a folder called answers located at the directory named conditionals.
You can reuse the same code we have used.
